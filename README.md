# Display Timings Calculator

## Purpose

Compute `hdmi_timings` and other timings for custom resolutions on my Raspberry Pi.
Possibly compute Modelines for X11.
Generate data that will allow to drive various displays the best we can, from any OS, on the command line.
Search automatically best timings for your display
Generate `vcgencmd hdmi_timings` commands as needed.
Learn how displays are driven.

## Non-purpose

This does not generate EDID or INF as of now. ToastyX's CRU is nice for that.
